A fun little reaction game  I've built as a side project
I've built this game in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using jQuery) to shrapen and practice my skills as well as gain a level of comfort with jQuery.
Please note that this game can not be properly hosted on GitHub and I have not decided on how or if I will host this website on a server as of yet.
